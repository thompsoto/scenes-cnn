# Scenes - a deep learning model
## Overview
This repository contains a model built using a convolutional neural network (specifically a LeNet-5 architecture) that detects scenes within images. Through this project, I gained familiarity with the PyTorch ML library, computer vision, and deep learning through a convolutional neural network architecture.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized is MiniPlaces, a scene recognition dataset developed by MIT. More information on the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/CSAILVision/miniplaces).
